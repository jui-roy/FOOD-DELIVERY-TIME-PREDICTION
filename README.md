# FOOD-DELIVERY-TIME-PREDICTION

Food delivery time prediction is an important task for online food delivery services. To predict the delivery time accurately, you'll need to analyze the data available in your dataset and identify the features that are most relevant to the delivery time. Some common features that can be used in food delivery time prediction models include the distance between the restaurant and the customer, the mode of transportation used for delivery, the time of day, and the day of the week.

In addition to analyzing the dataset and building predictive models, you may also want to consider using real-time data to improve delivery time predictions. This can be done by collecting data on factors such as traffic conditions, weather, and restaurant preparation times, and using this information to adjust delivery time estimates in real-time.


# Takeaways

Data Insight: Our food delivery time prediction project has the potential to improve customer satisfaction and increase operational efficiency for online food delivery services. By analyzing the data available in our dataset, we can gain insights into the factors that impact delivery time and identify ways to optimize our delivery process.

EDA: Exploratory data analysis is a crucial step in understanding the relationships between the features in our dataset and the delivery time. We can use techniques like data visualization and statistical analysis to uncover patterns and trends in the data, such as how delivery times vary by day of the week, time of day, and mode of transportation.

Feature Engineering: Once we have gained insights from our EDA, we can engineer new features that may be more predictive of delivery time. For example, we may create a feature that calculates the average preparation time for a restaurant, or a feature that takes into account traffic patterns in different parts of the city.

Model Building: With our engineered features, we can build a machine learning model to predict delivery times based on the factors that we have identified. We can use techniques like regression, decision trees, or neural networks to build a predictive model that takes into account the complex interactions between different features. By using real-time data to refine our model, we can continuously improve our predictions and provide more accurate delivery time estimates to our customers.





# SUMMARY
To predict the food delivery time in real time, you need to calculate the distance between the food preparation point and the point of food consumption. After finding the distance between the restaurant and the delivery locations, you need to find relationships between the time taken by delivery partners to deliver the food in the past for the same distance
